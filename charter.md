# Commit-and-Prove Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems WG Charter

## Motivation
Commit-and-Prove Zero-Knowledge Proof systems (CP-ZKPs) are a generalization of zero-knowledge proofs in which the prover proves statements about values that are committed.

## Scope of the working group and standard
The primary scope of the working group is standardizing terminology, definitions and protocols for commit-and-prove zero-knowledge proofs and related concepts, such as "encrypt-and-prove" (aka verifiable encryption).

## Milestones
- TBD

## Relation with other ZKProof working groups
This working group is the result of a merge of the [commit-and-prove](https://community.zkproof.org/g/WG_COMMIT_PROVE) and [SAVER](https://community.zkproof.org/g/WG_SAVER) working groups.
Some of the goals of this WG are related to the activities of the [ZKP-friendly](https://community.zkproof.org/g/WG_PRIMITIVES) WG.
